# Getting Started

For AxonIvy Marketplace, we have 3 parts: marketplace-ui, marketplace-service, and marketplace-build:
* ``marketplace-ui``: is an Angular project, built on v18 and contains the frontend code for the website.
* ``marketplace-service``: is a SpringBoot project, built on v3.2.5 and includes the apis code for the website.
* ``marketplace-build``: is a folder to keep everything related to build and dockers.
